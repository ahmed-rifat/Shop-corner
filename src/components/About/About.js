            <p className='font-medium p-20'>There's this notion that to grow a business, you have to be ruthless. But we know there's a better way to grow. One where what's good for the bottom line is also good for customers. We believe businesses can grow with a conscience, and succeed with a soul â€” and that they can do it with inbound. That's why we've created an ecosystem uniting software, education, and community to help businesses grow better every day.</p>
